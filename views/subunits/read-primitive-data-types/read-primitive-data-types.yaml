      - listItem: <strong>Null:</strong> intentionaly having no value
      - listItem: <strong>Undefined:</strong> a declared variable that hasn't been assigned a value yet
      - listItem: <strong>Symbol:</strong> a unique value that's not equal to any other value.  Note, this is an ES6 feature that never really took off, so don't worry about it for now.
